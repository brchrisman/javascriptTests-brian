Javascript Interview Tests

## Setup
Checkout the git repo then run

```
npm install
```

in the directory.  You'll need node.js installed in your environment.


## Transform
run

```
mocha tests/transform.mocha.js
```

to see the failing unit tests.  Fill in the function in transform.js.
This test is about understanding passing functions as arguments.  This is not a
 trick question, so a very simple implementation will work.
