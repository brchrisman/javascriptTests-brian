Javascript Interview Tests

## Setup
Clone the git repo then in the javascriptTests directory run

```
npm install
```

You'll need node.js installed in your environment.


## Test 1: Transform

run

```
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha --ui tdd test/transform.mocha.js
```

to see the failing unit tests.  Fill in the function in transform.js.
This test is about understanding passing functions as arguments.  This is not a
trick question, so a simple implementation will work.

## Test 2: Events

run

```
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha --ui tdd test/event.mocha.js
```

to see the failing unit test.  Fix the code in event.js to get all the unit
tests passing.
